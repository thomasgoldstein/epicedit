Epic Edit, Super Mario Kart track editor by Stifu and Midwife
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


v2.6.3 (???)
- Added support for cup and theme names editing
- Added support for driver ranking points allocation editing
- Added support for driver names editing
- Improved track graphics renderer, faster and more reliable.
  Fixes occasional display issues.
- Lowered the overlay tile maximum count from 42 to 41.
  Having 42 overlay tiles on a track causes tile glitches.
- Fixed 2bpp tile back color picking issues
- Fixed selected background tile image size
- Fixed invalid ROM loading, by keeping the previous ROM loaded
- When opening the background editor, automatically show the background
  of the current track theme (same behavior as the color palette editor)
- Minor tweaks and fixes


v2.6.2 (January 20th 2013)
- Fixed the fact background color picking would lay tiles
- Fixed the fact background color picking ignored the scrolling position


v2.6.1 (December 15th 2012)
- Fixed the fact that importing a background layout would not mark the
  layout as having been modified, preventing it from being resaved


v2.6 (October 21st 2012)
- Added codec tool to compress and decompress data (advanced users)
- Added support for defining the item probability set for each GP track
  (under the AI tab), which fixes the previous incorrect assumption
  that item probabilities depend on the track theme
  (and extended the .smkc format to include this data)
- Added ability to import and export color palettes, background layouts
  and item probabilities
- Added ability to import and export road and background tilesets as binary
- Fixed possible GP starting position second row offset loading issue
  (regressed in 2.1)
- Fixed background tileset graphics importing logic when the first of the
  4 colors does not match the first color of the first palette
  (never the case in the original game)
- Minor tweaks and fixes


v2.5.1 (June 25th 2012)
- Fixed possible ROM corruption issues when resaving color palettes
  (regressed in 2.4) and background layouts


v2.5 (June 23rd 2012)
- Added support for background editing (layout and graphics)
- Fixed the object extension hack introduced in v2.2 to work with ROMs
  that have a modified Luigi head sprite
- Added a config file to enable running the program with .NET 4.0
- Minor tweaks and fixes


v2.4.1 (January 10th 2012)
- Fixed compressed data saving issue with US ROMs, preventing some data
  from being properly decompressed when running the game


v2.4 (January 6th 2012)

- Added support for tile type, palette and graphics editing
- Made it so that common road tiles are no longer shared across themes,
  letting you have 256 unique tiles for each theme tileset,
  rather than 192 theme-specific tiles and 64 common ones (hacks by smkdan)
- Minor tweaks and fixes


v2.3 (September 30th 2011)

- Added color palette editor (by teknix1)
- Added undo/redo feature (for track tile changes only)
- Removed the Theme editor tab, and moved the Item probability editor
  to the menu bar
- Minor tweaks and fixes


v2.2 (July 23rd 2011)

- Added support for editing object properties, thanks to hacks by smkdan
  (and extended the .smkc format to include this data)
- Made the object zones of Koopa Beach 1 editable
  (KB1 and KB2 used to share the same zones)
- Display actual object sprites on the track map
- Show track objects that are out of their zone as grayed out, to hint that
  they most likely won't (fully) appear when playing the game
- Fixed Euro and Jap ROM corruption caused by the battle starting position
  hack, which only worked with US ROMs (thanks to smkdan again)
- Make block selection of tiles appear over the track, semi transparently
- Minor tweaks and fixes


v2.1 (February 28th 2011)

- Added support for driver starting position editing on battle tracks,
  with smkdan's help (and extended the .smkc format to include this data)
- Object zones now visually cover the whole track, not just the AI path(s)
- More accurate color conversions, making colors brighter (by teknix1)
- Added a full-screen mode, accessible through a menu button or F11
- Added a button to add new AI elements
  (was only possible by double clicking before)
- Fixed the size of the horizontal and vertical scroll bar thumbs,
  which now properly represent the size of the shown track portion
- Added ability to scroll horizontally with the mouse wheel (holding Shift)
- Minor tweaks and fixes


v2.0 (November 7th 2010)

- Smarter behavior when changing the index of an AI element.
  Rather than swapping the current index with the new index,
  it now shifts the index of all AI elements in between.
- Optimized screen real estate by making it so that when the track
  scrollbars are not necessary, they get hidden rather than disabled
- Optimized screen real estate by removing the status bar,
  the current cursor position being now displayed in the menu bar
- Replaced DotNetZip / Ionic.Zip library with SharpZipLib
  for GPL-incompatiblity reasons
- Made it possible to load non-compressed ROMs
  without the presence of the zip library DLL
- Various other fixes and optimizations

- Added the ability to reorder tracks by dragging them in the track list
